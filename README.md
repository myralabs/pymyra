# DEPRECATED: THESE APIs ARE NOT SUPPORTED ANY MORE.

# pymyra

The Python SDK for the Myra Conversational AI REST API. Myra's APIs are trained on over a billion news articles, conversational logs, and targeted web pages, and are paired with the latest AI research to deliver industry-leading intent parsing and entity extraction.

## Install

Using `pip`:
```bash
pip install pymyra
```

From source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/myralabs/pymyra
cd pymyra
pip install .
```

## Overview

`pymyra` provides access to the Myra RESTful APIs. It currently supports `Python 2.7`.

To continue, copy your API credentials from the `Explore API` tab. You can then replace the empty `account_id` and `account_secret` fields in the example below with your own.

See the [`tutorial`](https://github.com/myralabs/pymyra/tree/master/tutorial) directory for a step by step tutorial and examples.

## Minimal Example

Put this in `test.py`:

```python
from pymyra.api import client
import json

# Connect API
config = {
  "account_id": "...",  # Replace with the correct IDs after creating an account.
  "account_secret": "..."
}
api = client.connect(config)

# Set intent model
api.set_intent_model("...")  # Fill in intent model id from dashboard.

# Set entity model
api.set_entity_model("...")  # Fill in entity model id from dashboard.

# Get results
sentence = "Create a meeting with Alan Turing and Von Neumann next friday at 10am in Princeton"
result = api.get(sentence)

print("Sentence: %s" % sentence)
print("Inferred intent is '%s' with confidence %s" % (result.intent.label, result.intent.score))
print("Recognized entities are:\n%s" % json.dumps(result.entities.entity_dict, indent=4))
```

and you'll get:

```json
$ python test.py 
Sentence: Create a meeting with Alan Turing and Von Neumann next friday at 10am in Princeton
Inferred intent is 'create' with confidence 0.885836362839
Recognized entities are:
